# APP_Bday-invite-letter-generator

How it works:
- main.py takes names from invited_names.txt and creates separate invitation letters for each, based on the starting_letter.txt template
- invitation letters are generated inside the ReadyToSend folder (ignore the placeholder.py in it, it's just there so that the folder can exist) with each invitee in the fielname and in the header inside the invite
