# APP_Bday-invite-letter-generator

How it works:
- main.py takes names from invited_names.txt and creates separate .txt invitation letters for each, based on the starting_letter.txt template
- invitation letters are generated inside the ReadyToSend folder (ignore the placeholder.py in it, it's just there so that the folder can exist), with header and filename personalized to each invitee's name
